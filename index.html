    <h2 id="about-the-server">About The Server</h2>
    <h3>Server History</h3>
    <p class="content-text">The Mostly Serious Study Server was intially created in 2020 by a couple of friends who wanted to share study guides with each other and to help each other with schoolwork & academics. Over time, the server has grown to include over a hundred members, and has amassed a wide catalog of both member-created and external study materials and resources to attest to this. We hope that the server will continue to grow and help more people study & succeed. The Mostly Serious Study Server currently serves the Class of 2025.</p>
